# OVERBLOWN

An Overwatch clone split-screen multiplayer FPS with physics.  I created this as an attempt to get my kids to play one of my games, so I've copied ideas from their favourite games, including Overwatch and Piggy (/Roblox).

## Map Editor
The map editor is still in development.  The map editor will always edit the file "core/assets/maps/map_editor.json", so rename whatever map file you want to edit to that name.

To edit the texures used, manually edit the map json file.

* X - Remove block - press shift to confirm!
* Arrows & Pg Up/Pg Dn: Adjust model size/position/rotation/mass/texture depending on mode


## Notes for other Developers
* Development branch is the cutting edge but possibly broken branch.  Master is the most stable but out of date.
* Gradle is a real pain to work with.  However, if you have trouble loading this project, I used Gradle v4.10.3.
* The file Settings.java contains various settings that determine what game mode the game starts in.

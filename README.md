# OVERBLOWN

This is a split-screen multiplayer FPS with physics.  Originally this was an Overwatch spoof I created as an attempt to get my kids to play one of my games, so I copied ideas from their favourite games, including Overwatch and Piggy (/Roblox).  However, I've slowly added more and more game modes to it, so there's a bit of everything.

## Modifying the Game
You can modify a few game settings by editing the file "game.cfg".


## Map Editor
The map editor is still in development, and will only work properly by running the game from source (so the data files can be written back).

To edit the available texures, manually edit the map json file.

## Notes for other Developers
* Development branch is the cutting edge but possibly buggy/broken.  Master is the most stable but out of date.
* Gradle is a real pain to work with.  However, if you have trouble loading this project, I used Gradle v4.10.3.
* The file Settings.java contains various settings that determine what game mode the game starts in.
